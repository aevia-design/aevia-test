# Aevia — Project Guide for Claude Code

## What is Aevia
A premium photo book service based in Vienna. Concierge model: customer uploads photos → Aevia staff design the book → customer approves → then pays. Not automated — staff handle design manually. The tech moves orders from customer to Aevia reliably.

**Live Webflow site (old, being replaced):** https://aevia-v1.webflow.io  
**Target domain:** https://aevia.at (paid, not yet pointed)  
**Brand:** Premium, editorial, art-forward. Serif typography, generous whitespace, off-white/near-black palette.

**Local dev server:** run from project root, pages live at `http://localhost:8080/pages/home.html`

## Firebase backend (already live — do not rebuild)

- **Project ID:** `aevia-uploads`
- **Region:** `europe-west1`
- **GCS bucket:** `aevia-uploads.firebasestorage.app`
- **Firestore:** stores orders; auto-increments order numbers as `AEV-001`, `AEV-002`, etc.
- **Cloud Function:** `createUploadSession` — single HTTPS endpoint
  - Accepts: `customerName`, `email`, `templateName`, `pageCount`, `files[]`, optional `specialRequests`, `photoNotes`, `price`
  - Returns: `orderNumber`, `folderName`, `uploadUrls[]` (signed PUT URLs, valid 24h)
  - Sends two emails: customer confirmation + internal notification to `xenia@aevia.at`
- **Live endpoint:** `https://europe-west1-aevia-uploads.cloudfunctions.net/createUploadSession`

**To deploy function changes:**
```bash
cd functions
npm run deploy
```

**CORS allowed origins:** `aevia.at`, `www.aevia.at`, `*.webflow.io`, `localhost:*`

## Pages built so far

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pages/home.html` | Homepage |
| `pages/about.html` | About us |
| `pages/help.html` | FAQ / Help |
| `pages/collections.html` | All templates grid |
| `pages/bloom.html` | Product page — Bloom template (kids) |

## MVP v1 build order

1. **Order form page** (`pages/order.html`) — customer picks template + page count, uploads photos. Calls the live Firebase function above.
2. **Hosting** — deploy static site to Cloudflare Pages (free tier, connects to GitHub, deploys on push). Point `aevia.at` DNS to Cloudflare.
3. **Internal order dashboard** (`pages/dashboard.html`) — password-protected, shows submitted orders from Firestore, links to GCS folders. Plain HTML + Firebase SDK, no framework.
4. **PDF delivery + payment** — after design is done, email customer a watermarked PDF preview + Stripe Payment Link. Manual trigger for now.

---

## Coding conventions

- Plain HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no build tools
- Inline styles are acceptable for one-off layout tweaks
- All pages share the same nav and footer pattern — copy from an existing page
- Asset paths from `pages/` are `../assets/images/filename.png`
- Page-to-page links within `pages/` are just `pagename.html` (no path prefix)
- The owner is new to coding — explain technical decisions briefly when making them

## Secrets (never commit)

| Secret | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `EMAIL_USER` | `functions/.env` | Gmail account for sending emails |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | `functions/.env` | Gmail app password |
| `EMAIL_NOTIFY` | `functions/.env` | Internal notification recipient (`xenia@aevia.at`) |
| `serviceAccountKey.json` | `functions/` | Google Cloud service account for GCS signed URLs |

## Visual Development Guidelines

Design principles and brand rules are in:
- `context/design-principles.md` — spacing, colour, typography, what to flag
- `context/style-guide.md` — logo, nav/footer patterns, page inventory, backend info

### After making any visual change

1. Identify which pages were modified
2. Start local dev server (`npx serve . -p 8080` from project root)
3. Open changed pages in browser and check at desktop + mobile widths
4. Verify design matches `context/design-principles.md`
5. Check browser console for errors or 404s
6. Take a screenshot at 1440px desktop width to document the state

### For a full design review

Run `/design-review` to trigger the design review agent. It will open each modified page in a browser, test all three viewports, check links and interactions, and return a prioritised report.

Requires: local dev server running at `http://localhost:8080` and Playwright MCP configured.
