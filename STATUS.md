# Session Status
_Last updated: 2026-06-02 (session 19)_

## Status
Session 20 (2026-06-02) attempted **chunk-009 (Cloudflare Access)** and **retired it**. Findings: path-scoped Cloudflare Access can't enforce on a single `*.pages.dev` project (verified — unauth requests got 200, no challenge), and page-gating wouldn't close the real hole anyway (`firestore.rules` is `allow read: if true`; dashboard password `keanuredcat` + staff key `865865` are hardcoded in client JS, scrapeable). Founder's real need = only authorised people can reach/tamper with the dashboard. **Decision: real staff login via Firebase Auth** — now **chunk-018** in a new ROADMAP "Phase 2.5 — Security hardening (do next)", superseding chunk-009. Done & kept this session: staff pages moved to `pages/staff/` (commit `c2682a2`, pushed; live, links/assets verified, 57/57 tests pass). **Next session = build chunk-018 fresh.**

### Earlier (session 19)
Session 19 built **chunk-008 — "Approved for print" dashboard button** (developer-agent + independent verify). Committed `70db5d1`, pushed; `markSentToPrint` deployed by user and verified live (a paid order flipped to `sent_to_print` in both dashboard and Firestore). chunk-008 is DONE. Decided: button only, no CLI (resolves the open question). Also installed jest at repo root so `npm test` runs (57/57 pass) and deleted two stale motif-engine trial files.

### Earlier (session 18)
Fixed bugs from the chunk-007 end-to-end test (8 issues + 4 follow-ups). Committed `0d2d8f7`, pushed; `getOrder` redeployed. **Verified:** #9 PDF — cover + all SVG overlays render in `--order` mode (AEV-021 clean).

**UNTESTED in browser (verify next session):**
- #2 post-payment thank-you screen (skips book reload on `?payment=success`)
- #3 rotating reassurance lines on customer book load (counter kept)
- #4 paste-as-plain-text in caption editors (both engines)
- Thank-you screen showing the exact customer email (needs deployed `getOrder` — done)

**Other fixes this session (lower risk):** #8 pay button appears after approve; #3 order-form "undefined" hint gone; #1 spine labels; #5 caption toolbar no longer clips/overlaps; #6 birthday text box true flexbox centering (now matches PDF); #4 order-form scroll stall fixed via downscaled display thumbnails.

### Earlier
- Session 17: chunk-007 full PDF pipeline (see `sessions/2026-06-02.md`).
- Sessions 11–16: chunks 001–006, Stripe, heart crop (see `sessions/2026-06-01.md`).

**Meta-task bar (user, explicit):** customer-rendered book must look EXACTLY like staff (fonts, styling, captions, photo positions, spreads, cover). Customer can change photo sequence, captions, caption styling AND alignment, always using our layout.

## Immediate next steps
1. **chunk-018 — Staff authentication (Firebase Auth)** ← **NEXT, high priority.** Real login for dashboard + engine; lock `firestore.rules` to authed staff; functions verify ID token not the static key; delete hardcoded password/key. See ROADMAP Phase 2.5 for full spec + build order. **Critical: step 2 = get your own login working before tightening rules, or you lock yourself out.** Also: delete the non-enforcing Cloudflare self-hosted Access app in the dashboard (illusion of protection).
2. **Browser-verify Session 18 untested items** (#2, #3, #4, thank-you email) — see UNTESTED list above. Test #2 needs a fresh order paid via Stripe (returns with `?payment=success`).
3. **TO-DO #56** — post-payment confirmation email to the customer (only staff notified on payment today).
4. **Switch Stripe to live mode** — when real website is deployed.

## Deferred
- **Playwright browser tests** — deferred until customer preview is stable in production.
- **chunks 010–017** — Template digitisation. Wait for CSV + SVG files from Kseniia.
- **TO-DO #50** — sentSnapshot visual view (`?view=sent`). Low priority.
- **TO-DO #51** — Customer preview load performance. Low priority.
- **Verify #55 in customer-preview view** — confirm heart crop renders identically (read-only) on a live customer preview link. Do with a real new order.

## Open questions
1. **PDF script shared access** — each installs Node locally (near-term) vs Cloud Run job (long-term). Resolve before second founder needs to generate PDFs.
2. **Stripe live mode** — requires live website URL for full Stripe account activation. Currently running in test mode.

## Open watch-outs
- **(S20)** **Known exposure, accepted short-term until chunk-018:** `firestore.rules` `allow read: if true` → all orders world-readable; anonymous `update` branch allows status/token tampering; dashboard password + staff key are in client JS. Live now at `aevia-test.pages.dev/pages/staff/*` (ungated). Low risk while data is all-test; chunk-018 closes it. Do NOT onboard a real customer before chunk-018 ships.
- **(S20)** chunk-018 build order matters: enable Firebase Auth + create accounts → add login to dashboard and confirm YOU can get in → switch functions to ID token (keep static key one step in parallel) → tighten `firestore.rules` → delete password/key → mirror onto engine. Tightening rules before your login works = locked out.
- **(S20)** A non-enforcing Cloudflare self-hosted Access app (`Aevia Staff`, dest `aevia-test.pages.dev/pages/staff/*`) exists in Zero Trust — delete it; it protects nothing.
- **(S19)** chunk-008: `markSentToPrint` write is admin-SDK (Cloud Function) → bypasses `firestore.rules`, no allowlist entry needed. Button only renders on `paid` orders and 404s until the function is deployed (`firebase deploy --only functions:markSentToPrint`). This function is the future hook for Elanders/SiteFlow API submission (P2) — plug the API call inside it, no UI rebuild.
- **(S19)** Repo-root `npm test` (jest) now works but needs `npm install` at repo root on a fresh clone — separate from `scripts/npm install` for the PDF export. `node_modules/` is gitignored.
- **(S18)** `scripts/export-pdf.js`: any constant derived from `MM_TO_PX`/`BLEED_MM`/`MM_TO_PT` MUST be assigned inside `initializePrintConstants()`, not at module top — they're lazy in `--order` mode. Module-load math gives `NaN` (broke cover + all SVGs).
- **(S18)** Order-form thumbnails are downscaled display-only copies (`_thumbUrl`). Full-res `_objUrl` is used for the lightbox AND the GCS upload (`fileObjects`) — never swap the upload to the thumbnail. PDF unaffected (pulls full-res originals from GCS).
- **(S18)** Birthday textPanel centering: engine now uses flexbox; PDF centers via `(boxHeight − textHeight)/2`. Both read `valign:'center'` from CSV. A future Top/Mid/Bottom toolbar control would need the PDF to read `ov.valign` too (currently reads `capDef.valign` only).
- **(S18)** `getOrder` now returns `email` — used by the post-payment thank-you screen. Deployed.
- **(S17)** GCS folder naming: new orders use `AEV-001/` as folder. Old test orders use `templatename_customername_date/` — their Firestore `folderName` still points to old path, they still work.
- **(S17)** `scripts/node_modules` must be installed (`cd scripts && npm install`) on any fresh clone before running PDF export.
- **(S17)** `npm run pdf -- AEV-001` runs from `scripts/` dir (not repo root). The `--` is required npm syntax to pass the order number to the script.
- **(S17)** `updatePdfLinks()` in dashboard fires two HTTP calls per visible order on every table render. Fine at current volumes; revisit if order count grows significantly.
- **(S15)** Stripe webhook idempotency: guard checks `order.status === 'paid'` before writing.
- **(S15)** `createCheckoutSession` validates `order.status === 'approved'` before creating a session.
- **(S15)** Three Stripe env vars in `functions/.env`: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`. Never commit. Swap all three for live equivalents when going live.
- **(S14)** Heart crop parity: engine sets `object-position: x% y%`; PDF computes `window-left = (scaledW − CONTENT_PX) × x/100`. Don't change one side's math without the other.
- **(S12)** Book layout saved by photo **basename**, not pool index. `assignmentsToNames`/`assignmentsToIndices` in BOTH engines — keep in sync.
- **(S12)** Staff `renderBook` auto-arranges UNLESS `window._restoreState` is set. Don't remove the guard.
- **(S11)** `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` cannot be nested inside `arrayUnion`. Use `Timestamp.now()` inside array entries only.
- **(S11)** Any new field written from the browser must be added to the `hasOnly([...])` allowlist in `firestore.rules`.
- **(S9)** Customer load precedence: customer > staff > defaults.
- **(S8)** Customer & staff are parallel copies of the same render logic — change one, mirror the other.
